## Chrome Extension Companion

This application has a companion [The Howler Chrome Extension](https://github.com/CjMoore/howler-extension). Set up details for the extension are on that repo. It enables the user to select text in their browser and send that text to be analyzed to our application. It will open a new window with the analysis on a show page for the text.
